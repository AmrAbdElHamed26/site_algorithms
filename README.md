## Features

- **Algorithm Visualization:** The project provides visualizations for various algorithms, allowing users to see how different algorithms work step by step.

- **Flutter Web:** Built using Flutter web technology, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience across different devices.

- **CI/CD with Code Magic:** Site Algorithms integrates continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) using Code Magic. This ensures automated testing and deployment processes, making development more efficient.

- **Unit Testing:** The project includes unit tests to maintain code reliability and ensure that algorithms function correctly.

- **Animation with Flutter:** Animated visualizations make understanding algorithms more engaging and intuitive. Flutter's animation capabilities are utilized to enhance the user experience.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Traverse a graph using depth-first exploration.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explore a graph layer by layer using breadth-first traversal.

3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Find the shortest path between nodes in a graph.
